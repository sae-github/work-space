It is the first manned test flight with two astronauts on board.Boeing and US defence giant Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), opens new The vehicle was launched after being attached to an Atlas V rocket by the United Launch Alliance (ULA), a joint venture between Boeing and ULA. It is scheduled to head to the International Space Station (ISS) to carry out its first docking manoeuvre and return home in about a week. Plans for the manned test flight of the Starliner have experienced significant delays. On two occasions, last-minute problems with launches, on 6 May and on 1 May this month, had also led to cancellations. Boeing's management was shaken by a series of crises surrounding the 737MAX in its commercial aircraft business, and the success of the Starliner was essential. With the development of the Starliner, Boeing aims to compete with SpaceX's Crew Dragon, led by US entrepreneur Elon Musk.Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
